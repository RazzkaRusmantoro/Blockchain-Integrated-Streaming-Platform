Run code (terminal):
`npm install`
`npm run dev` to start localhost

==========================================================================================================================

The platform is intended to bring fans and players together by inviting more engagement, while making use of web3 systems.
Fans can opt to pay for virtual watch-party rooms which enables them to have an immersive viewing experience; fans will have more control over what they watch, and who they watch (unlike current days, esports events have spectator operators in charge of controlling the viewing cameras, which limits fans to see the P.O.V they want. In the watch parties, fans will have control on who they want to watch, individually by each player from each team, through decentralised streams and transactions.)

*When in watch party, click on players 1 through 5, or the profile icon to swap teams to spectate any one. The intent of this process is to enable to view streams while spectating any viewing angle they desire.
